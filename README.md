# Business-Analytics-Mini-Projects
Mini projects done in my classes of Machine Learning, Database Management and R in Business Statistics.

**Machine Learning | Python | Google Colab**                                                                                             

- Analyzed the application of Just Walk Out Technology developed by Amazon across various industries and theorized a machine learning model to evaluate customer perceptions and satisfaction, with data fields comprising numerical and categorical variables. Data would be sourced from store sensors, customer transactions, and feedback.
- Collaborated with five teammates to develop a machine learning system using a dataset with 10 features and 100,000 data points, including key soil parameters and environmental factors, to predict the most suitable crop for maximum yield.
- Worked alongside five teammates to implement and evaluate models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Forest.
- Partnered with five teammates to conduct model training (72% train, 28% test split), apply cross-validation, and evaluate performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and ROC Curve.

**Database Management | SQL | NoSQL | MongoDB | JSON | Visual Studio Code | Pipelines**                                                                          

- Created an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and subsequently a database using Microsoft SQL Server. Designed the database with appropriately named entities based on the dataset and ensured proper normalization. Added appropriate Foreign Keys (FK) to establish relationships between entities. Inserted 10 rows of data into each table and wrote SELECT statements to confirm the results.
- Developed a JSON script in Visual Studio for a Carolina's Cinema business scenario and imported data into MongoDB Compass to create four collections populated with ten documents each.
- Exported data as CSV and JSON; documented data types and business purpose in a Word file.
- Built a MongoDB playground in Visual Studio Code to perform CRUD operations and created aggregation pipelines for each collection.

 **Business Statistics | R | RStudio**                                                                                                                      

- Loaded and analyzed 9 datasets ranging from 67 to 20,807 instances using RStudio.
- Performed data exploration through descriptive statistics, histograms, boxplots, density plots, and QQ plots.
- Constructed confidence intervals, interpreted p-values, and conducted statistical modeling, including simple, multiple, logistic regressions, time series analysis, and ANOVA.
- Gained proficiency in R-Markdown for reporting and documentation.
- Learned and applied concepts in mathematical optimization and network optimization using Solver in Excel.
